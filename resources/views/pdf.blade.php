        <div class="content">
            One thing Google takes very seriously is the existence of unnatural links pointing to your website and you're currently in the danger zone for some major penalties. When it comes to your link profile, "black hat" tactics such as purchasing links, excessive link exchanges, blog spam, comment spam and online directories are a sure-fire way of getting hit with Google penalties that can take up to several months to resolve. While proper link building methods can seem exhaustive and time-consuming, it is crucial to the success of your online business.
